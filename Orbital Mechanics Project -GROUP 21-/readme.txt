 						1) GANYMEDE, EUROPA AND IO ’S REAL EPHEMERIS IMPORT DATA (avoidable section)

Real ephemeris for Ganymede, Europa ,Io and Jupiter are contained in file “HORIZON_data.mat ”.
Hereafter we deliver the instructions to generate “HORIZON_data.mat ” file starting from the four “.txt” files acquired directly from Horizons.

“data_Ganymede.txt” 
“data_Io.txt”        —————> “generation_file_data.m” ————> “HORIZON_data.mat”                                                                                            
“data_Europa.txt”
“data_Jupiter.txt”





								
								2)  OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURE.

Run “project_OPTIMUM_research.m” and select the desired time-steps for the two TOFs (same for both) and T_0.


                              TOF_1 (time of flight for the transfer from Ganymede to Io)
project_OPTIMUM_research.m——> TOF_2 (time of flight for the transfer from Io to Europa)
                              T_0   (departure date from Ganymede)



!!TIME-STEPS MUST BE MULTIPLE OF 2 HOURS!!

To get our results set all these 3 time steps equal to 2 hours (takes 1 day to run).
to get immediate results time-step T_0~7000h & TOFs~24h






								  3) OPTIMAL TRANSFER.

Run file “project_OPTIMUM_plot.m” and insert desired values for TOF_1, TOF_2 and T_0. (optimal values obtained in section 2) are suggested). 

                             Dates at which each impulse must be provided.
                             Cost of each impulse required for the transfer
“project_OPTIMUM_plot.m” ——> Keplerian parameters of all orbits and trajectories
                             Plots of the overall transfer

At the end of this procedure “OPTIMUM_data.mat” file will be generated. This file is strictly necessary to run perturbation analysis (it will be automatically recalled).


OUR OPTIMAL VALUES ARE:      TOF_1=180000 s  
			     TOF_2=165600 s
                             T_0=106941600 s

                                                      






								4)  PERTURBATION ANALYSIS

VOP approach for perturbation analysis is implemented in 4 matlab scripts relative to the 4 different perturbative effects evaluated.
To observe short and long period analysis’ results for each perturbative effect run the following scripts:

“perturbation_SOLAR_RAD_PRESS.m”

“perturbation_THIRD_BODY.m”

“perturbation_NON_UNIF_MASS.m”

“perturbation_total.m”


!!BE SURE TO RUN SECTION 3) BEFORE PERTURBATION ANALYSIS TO GENERATE THE NECESSARY DATA FILE!!



Ps:
A much more detailed description of how all these softwares works is contained in  file: PROJECT_REPORT.pdf.
